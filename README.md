# WI-XIRR

A fast XIRR calulator for Ruby

## Introduction

This gem uses a pure C implementation of the newtonian method for XIRR calculation.

It also uses native extensions instead of ffi so that deployed containers need not have a C compiler to run the calculation

## Installation

In your Gemfile, add

    gem 'wi_xirr'

And then run

    bundle install

## Usage

    require 'time'

    # Cash Flow
    amounts = [1000, -600, -6000]
    dates = [Time.parse("1985-01-01").to_f, Time.parse("1990-01-01").to_f, Time.parse("1995-01-01").to_f]
    max_iterations = 1000
    initial_guess = 0

    result = WiXirr.calculate(amounts, dates, initial_guess, max_iterations)

## Supported Versions

Ruby 2.5 and later

## References

This gem was derived from the xirr gem, which supports both newtonian and bisection methods and uses ffi for inline compilation, which might be a better fit based on your needs - https://github.com/grafeno-sa/xirr
